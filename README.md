# Harry Potter characters finder 🧙

## Description

Hi there! 👋🏻 I am Laura Moreno and this is my final evaluation exercise: Harry Potter Characters⚡.
The exercise consists of developing a web page with a list of Harry Potter characters.

## Objetives

At the beginning, the Gryffindor characters will appear in alphabetical order.

The name and species will appear on your card. In case of not having a photo, Hedwig will appear with a warning letter.

If we want to know more information about the character, we can select it and expand the information to status (alive or dead), gender, house and alternative name.

You can filter by name or by house

## Features to implement in the future 🔁

- LocalStorage.
