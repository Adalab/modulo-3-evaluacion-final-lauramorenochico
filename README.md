# HARRY POTTER CHARACTER FINDER 🧙

Hi there! 👋🏻 I am Laura Moreno and this is my final evaluation exercise: Harry Potter Characters ⚡.
The exercise consists of developing a web page with a list of Harry Potter characters.

## Objetives

At the beginning, the Gryffindor characters will appear in alphabetical order.
.
The name and species will appear on your card. In case of not having a photo, Hedwig will appear with a warning letter.
.
If we want to know more information about the character, we can select it and expand the information to status (alive or dead), gender, house and alternative name.
.
You can filter by name or by house

## Features to implement in the future 🔁 --
